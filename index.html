			<p>Vincent Nguyen here to surprise. I am learning to be a developer not only to just find a new job to make some money, but as a way to personally perserve my mind. I am a tinkerer and working through problems creates certain satisfaction not found in many places.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Aside from learning to be a developer I channel my abilities in building race cars at Boost Logic. There we push the mechancial capabilities of vehicles to the breaking point. It is a mental and physical race to produce results.
